	<h1>🏃Running Advantages🏃 </h1>
	<ul>
		<li><u>Better cardio health</u>-Running, or jogging, is one of the best cardio exercises you can do. Running for at least 10 minutes a day can significantly lower your risk of cardiovascular disease. Runners lower their chances of dying from heart disease by half.It also lowers your resting heart rate, the number of times your heart beats per minute when you’re at rest. This is an important indicator of your overall health and fitness The lower the rate, the more efficient your heartbeat.</li>
		<br><li><u>Better sleep quality</u> - sleep is essential for your health. Your body repairs itself when you're asleep, which is why you wake up feeling refreshed. But try to avoid running too late in the day. This can interfere with how well you sleep at night. Aerobic exercise triggers a release of endorphins, chemicals that help relieve pain or stress. These activate the brain and might keep you awake.</li>
		<br><li><u>Improved knee and back health</u> -A study of 675 marathon runners found that they had a lower arthritis rate than other people. The runners’ knees and backs were both positively affected. The more you run, the lower your odds of back problems as you age.</li>
		<br><li><u>Improved memory</u> -If you find that you have problems with your memory, get running. It affects your brain in the short and long term. Aerobic exercise gets your heart rate up and makes you sweat. This can boost the size of your hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning.</li>
		<br><li><u>Mental State</u> -Running prepares you to cope with daily stress and challenges without getting panicked. You will stop overthinking and feel more relaxed. This is because running can immediately reduce the activity in frontal cortex. This makes running the simplest and the healthiest way to break free from the daily grind.</li>
